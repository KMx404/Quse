* Used the pyAesCrypt as the main module of the AES encryption. <br />
* Simple typed encryption with easy edits. Change the common passwords by editing the source code. <br /> 
* Its meant to be dynamic, the commented parts are a way to go for the next version. <br />


## For future features! <br /> 
#### :pushpin: Added modules! <br />
1- First, install Python library ```pyaes``` that implements the AES symetric key encryption algorithm: <br />
			```pip install pyaes``` <br /> <br />

2- Next, install the Python library ```pbkdf2``` that implements the PBKDF password-to-key derication algorithm: <br />
			```pip install pbkdf2``` <br />
